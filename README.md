[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/adilmirzz/VisionAI-ImageRecognition/blob/main/image_ai_bootcamp.ipynb)

ðŸš€ **An end-to-end Image Recognition AI project** built in Python using Deep Learning (TensorFlow/Keras), trained to classify images with high accuracy.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project was developed during a 5-day bootcamp to guide participants from zero to building a complete **image recognition model** using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transfer Learning.

It covers:
- Image preprocessing & augmentation
- CNN model training & evaluation
- Transfer learning with MobileNetV2
- Visualization of metrics & predictions
- Documentation for a recruiter-ready portfolio

---

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn
- **Tools:** Google Colab (GPU), GitHub
- **Dataset:** CIFAR-10 / Cats vs Dogs (Kaggle)
